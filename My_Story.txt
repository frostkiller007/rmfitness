Let me start by introducing myself. My name is Rishabh Mansharamani and I am 24 years old.
I am a health, fitness and lifestyle coach, operating both, online and through a personal studio based
out of Mumbai, India. (Insert picture 1)
Flashback to childhood, being a skinny kid I was super active and athletic. Having gone through a
rough time of bullying and heartbreak, I had lost all identity and self esteem. School got over and I
joined the gym, for all the wrong reasons (impress girls and get six pack abs). But it did get any better.
I was far off from achieving my goals due to the following reasons: (Insert picture 2)
* Poor nutrition
* Incorrect training mechanisms
* Lack of proper guidance
* Lack of discipline
* Egoistic and self centered attitude
So I decided to put down my ego and make a much needed change. Having gone through all the
wrong doings, I knew what did not work. It was now time to focus all my energy and efforts in
learning what actually works.
Fast forward 8 years, here I am, changing lives for the better. I now work with 50+ clients on a
monthly basis, with the sole objective of providing correct guidance in fitness and nutrition, helping
them achieve their goals, and ultimately transforming lives. (Insert picture 3)
